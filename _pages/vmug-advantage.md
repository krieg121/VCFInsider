## Why I recommend VMUG Advantage for VCF Admins

If you're building skills in **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)**, **vSphere**, **Aria**, **NSX**, or automation, **VMUG Advantage** is one of the most practical ways to stay connected to the community and level up through member benefits and learning resources.

### Highlights (what I point people to)
- **Exclusive webinars and training** access for members
- **Discounts on VMware certification exams**
- **Member support resources** (including an AI-powered support benefit)
- **Home lab / non-production licensing pathway** (details/eligibility can change — see FAQ below)

### Notes on home lab licensing (important)
VMUG has published updates explaining that **EvalExperience access changed after Nov 30, 2024**, and that a newer pathway for **VCF / VVS licensing** is tied to **Broadcom’s VCP program**. Read the current VMUG Advantage FAQ for the latest details.
