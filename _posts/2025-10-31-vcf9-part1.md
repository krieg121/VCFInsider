> **TL;DR**  
> VCF 9 formalizes **Private Cloud → Fleet → Instance → Domains** and offers two resilience patterns: **Fault Domains (Site-HA across zones)** for metro continuity within a single instance, and **Disaster Recovery** (two instances across regions) orchestrated with VMware Live Site Recovery.

## Why VCF 9 Feels Different
VCF 9 clarifies the relationship between **Private Clouds**, **Fleets**, and **Instances**. An **Instance** contains your **Management Domain** (SDDC Manager, vCenter, NSX) plus one or more **Workload Domains**. Fleet services (Operations/Automation) layer on top to unify lifecycle, governance, and provisioning across instances.

## Key Concepts

### VCF Instance
A complete, self-contained VCF deployment with its **own Management Domain** and **zero or more Workload Domains**. This is the unit you operate, upgrade, and (optionally) pair for DR.

### VCF Fleet
The centralized management umbrella that groups one or more instances under **VCF Operations** (lifecycle/health/config) and **VCF Automation** (provisioning). It standardizes identity, certificates, password policy, tags, and licensing.

### VCF Private Cloud
The top-level construct representing your whole environment—governance, catalogs, networking, and lifecycle—under which you organize **Fleets**, and inside each Fleet you manage **Instances**.

## Fleet Design Options
There are a few ways you can configure your fleets depending on your needs.

### Basic Design
Straightforward deployment of Operations/Automation + SDDC Manager. No across-zone or cross-region resilience built in.

### Deployment with Site High Availability (Fault Domains / Across Zones)
**Goal:** survive an **AZ/site** failure within a single instance using metro-distance, **synchronous** storage and IP portability.

- **Storage:** vSAN **stretched clusters** (two data sites + witness) or **vMSC** with synchronous array replication.  
- **Networking:** L2 stretch or NSX/LB approaches for IP continuity.  
- **Control planes:** NSX Manager nodes across zones; VCF Operations/Automation in HA models; place vCenter/SDDC Manager for survivability.  
- **Typical guardrails:** ~**≤5 ms** RTT between data sites for vSAN; ~**≤10 ms** RTT host↔array for vMSC (vendor-specific).

### Deployment with Disaster Recovery (Across Regions)
**Goal:** survive a **regional event** using **two VCF instances** (Primary/Recovery) and **VMware Live Site Recovery** (SRM + vSphere Replication and/or array replication). No stretched L2/compute/storage; recovery is orchestrated with **Protection Groups** and **Recovery Plans** (boot order, scripts, IP/DNS changes, LB retargets). Some platform services are restored from backup per the validated guidance. Test regularly; document failback.

### Combined: Fault Domains + DR
Use **Site-HA** for AZ failures within a region/instance and **DR** for regional disasters—a common layered design for enterprise continuity targets.
